# InfiltrationBot
This "InfiltrationBot" allows you to mute and deafen yourself from a Discord audio or video call simply by typing the '=dip' in any chat of the server. This action can be reversed by typing the '=m' command. The bot notifies all users in the call except for the person using the command, that the person is currentyl unavailable.

This bot uses JavaScript, Discord.js, and node.js. A version with command handlers and a SQLite database keeping track of how often someone gets 'infiltrated' will be added after proper testing.
